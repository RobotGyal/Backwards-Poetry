Snow falling from the Heavens
To the great earth below
Like little pieces of sugar
The children love more
Than hot summer days
Snow falling on my window pane
As quiet as the first springs blossoming
As memorable as a newborn child’s kiss
An everlasting forever
An inerasable mark
Snow mending to many shapes
Snowmen, Snowballs, Snowangels
Expressing people and their thoughts
Some of the world’s strongest ideals
Creating something anew
Snow drifting all around
Landing on my face and hair
Making a once in a lifetime crown
The world’s most beautiful necklace
Nature’s jewelry
Snow fading through the day
Dwindling to a nothingness
From snowmen to Snowbaby
From Snowball to Snowmarble
Until there is no more
